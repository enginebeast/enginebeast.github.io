<h2>Kirchhoff's voltage law(KCL)</h2>
If there are n currents flowing into or out of a node, they satisfy the following equation.

$$
\begin{flalign*}
\sum^n_{i=1} I_i = 0 &&
\end{flalign*}
$$

Therefore, we can find any unknown current as follows.

$$
\begin{flalign*}
I_j = -\sum^n_{i\neq j} I_i &&
\end{flalign*}
$$

<h2>Kirchhoff's voltage law(KVL)</h2>
If there are n voltages in a closed loop, they satisfy the following equation.
$$
\begin{flalign*}
\sum^n_{i=1} V_i = 0 &&
\end{flalign*}
$$

Therefore, we can find any unknown voltage as follows.

$$
\begin{flalign*}
V_j = -\sum^n_{i\neq j} V_i &&
\end{flalign*}
$$
