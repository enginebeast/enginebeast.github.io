## Coulomb's law


In Coulomb's law, force between two charges is defined as follows.

$$\vec{F_e} = k_e\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}\hat{r}$$

Where \(k_e\) is Coulomb constant defined by the following equation.

$$k_e = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}$$

Also, \(\epsilon_0\) means permittivity of free space.

## Charge is quantized

It means that charge has discrete value. Also, we can indicate this sentence as follows.

$$q = ne$$

Where, n is integer which is not zero, and e is elementary charge.

## Charge is conversed
There is three examples -radioactive decay, pair annihilation, pair production-.
