<h2>Definition of electric field</h2>

    $$
    \begin{flalign*}
    \vec{E} = \frac{\vec{F}}{q_0} &&
    \end{flalign*}
    $$

    Where, \(q_0\) is test charge which become the standard of electric fields.<br>
    <br>
    By the Coulomb's law, we can get the following equation.
    $$
    \begin{flalign*}
    \vec{E} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{qq_0}{r^2}\hat{r}\frac{1}{q_0} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q}{r^2}\hat{r} &&
    \end{flalign*}
    $$

<h2>The electric field due to a point charge</h2>
$$
\begin{flalign*}
\vec{E} = \sum^n_{i=1}\vec{E_i} &&
\end{flalign*}

<h2>The electric field due to an electric dipole</h2>
<details>
    <summary>fold/unfold</summary>
    An electric dipole is a system consisting of two equal and opposite charges, q and -q, separated by certain distance.
    The equation for electric dipole moment is as follows.

    $$
    \begin{flalign*}
    \vec{E} = \frac{1}{2\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{qd}{z^3} &&
    \end{flalign*}
    $$

    Where d is a distance between two charge, and z is a distance between center of two charge and a test charge.
