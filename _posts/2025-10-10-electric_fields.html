<h2>Definition of electric field</h2>
<details>
    <summary>fold/unfold</summary>
    $$
    \begin{flalign*}
    \vec{E} = \frac{\vec{F}}{q_0} &&
    \end{flalign*}
    $$

    Where, \(q_0\) is test charge which become the standard of electric fields.
    And its SI is a newton per coulomb(N/C).<br>
    <br>
    By the Coulomb's law, we can get the following equation.
    $$
    \begin{flalign*}
    \vec{E} = k_e \frac{qq_0}{r^2}\hat{r}\frac{1}{q_0} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q}{r^2}\hat{r} &&
    \end{flalign*}
    $$

<h2>The electric field due to several point charges</h2>
We can find the net electric field as follows.

$$
\begin{flalign*}
\vec{E} = \sum^n_{i=1}\vec{E_i} &&
\end{flalign*}
$$

<h2>The electric field due to an electric dipole</h2>
<details>
    <summary>fold/unfold</summary>
    An electric dipole is a system consisting of two equal and opposite charges, q and -q, separated by certain distance.
    The equation for a magnitude of its electric field is as follows.

    $$
    \begin{flalign*}
    E = k_e \frac{2qd}{z^3} &&
    \end{flalign*}
    $$

    Where d is a distance between two charge, and z is a distance between center of two charge and a test charge.

    <summary>fold/unfold</summary>
    $$
    \begin{flalign*}
    \vec{E} = k_e \int \frac{dq}{r^2}\hat{r} &&
    \end{flalign*}
    $$
    
    Linear charge density
    $$
    \begin{flalign*}
    \lambda = dq/dL &&
    \end{flalign*}
    $$

    Surface charge density
    $$
    \begin{flalign*}
    \sigma = dq/dA &&
    \end{flalign*}
    $$

    Volume charge density
        $$
    \begin{flalign*}
    \rho = dq/dV &&
    \end{flalign*}
    $$
