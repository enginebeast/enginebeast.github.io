<h2>Coulomb's law</h2>
<details>
    <summary>fold/unfold</summary>
    In Coulomb's law, force between two charges is defined as follows.
    $$
    \begin{flalign*}
    \vec{F_e} = k_e\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}\hat{r} &&
    \end{flalign*}
    $$
    <br>

    Where \(k_e\) is Coulomb constant defined by the following equation.
    $$
    \begin{flalign*}
    k_e = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} &&
    \end{flalign*}
    $$
    <br>

    Also, \(\epsilon_0\) means permittivity of free space.

<h2>Charge is quantized</h2>
It means that charge has discrete value. Also, we can indicate this sentence as follows.

$$
\begin{flalign*}
q = ne &&
\end{flalign*}
$$

Where, n is integer which is not zero, and e is elementary charge.<br>

<h2>Charge is conversed</h2>
There is three examples -radioactive decay, pair annihilation, pair production-.
