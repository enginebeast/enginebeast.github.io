<h2>Property of charge</h2>
First, charge is quantized. It means that charge has discrete value. Also, we can indicate this sentence as follows.

$$
\begin{flalign*}
q = ne &&
\end{flalign*}
$$

Where, n is integer which is not zero, and e is elementary charge.<br>

Second, charge is conversed. There is three examples -radioactive decay, pair annihilation, pair production-.
