## Kirchhoff's voltage law(KCL)

If there are n currents flowing into or out of a node, they satisfy the following equation.

$$\sum^n_{i=1} I_i = 0$$

Therefore, we can find any unknown current as follows.

$$I_j = -\sum^n_{i\neq j} I_i$$

## Kirchhoff's voltage law(KVL)

If there are n voltages in a closed loop, they satisfy the following equation.

$$\sum^n_{i=1} V_i = 0$$

Therefore, we can find any unknown voltage as follows.

$$V_j = -\sum^n_{i\neq j} V_i$$
