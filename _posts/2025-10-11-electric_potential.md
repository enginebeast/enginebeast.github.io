## Definition of electric potential energy

Relationship between potential energy and work can be defined by following equation.

$$\Delta U = U_f - U_i = -W$$

When two charged particles are infinitely far apart, their initial potential energy, $$U_i$$ is defined zero. 
In this scenario, as two particles move closer together, final potential energy is, $$U_f$$ is equal to the negative work done by the electric force.

$$U_f = U = -W$$

Although, infinite distance does not make sense in the real world, this concept serves as usual idealization.
We use it to model the enegy change when two particles begin two interact from a state of no interaction.
This is similar to how we often use models in physics that ignore friction to simplify problems.

## Definition of electric potential

$$V = \frac{U}{q}$$

Its SI unit is volt(V) or joule per coulomb(J/C).
