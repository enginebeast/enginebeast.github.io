<h2>Definition of electric potential energy</h2>
We know that relationship between potential energy and work can be indicated by following equation.
    $$
    \begin{flalign*}
    \Delta U = U_f - U_i = -W &&
    \end{flalign*}
    $$

When two particle which far away from infinite distance close into each other, /(U_i/) become zero and we can define the electric potential energy as follows.
    $$
    \begin{flalign*}
    U_f = U = -W &&
    \end{flalign*}
    $$

Of course, infinite distance is not possible in the real world. But, the concept is used to suppose the situation that interation of two particles go to existance from not-existance.
It's same as we often to suppose the situation that friction does not exist.

    Where \(q_{enc}\) is net charge, and \(\epsilon_0\) is permittivity of free space.<br>
    <br>
    If \(q_{enc}\) is positive, a net flux heads to the outside. 
    And if \(q_{enc}\) is negative, a net flux heads to the inside.
