## Definition

$$\vec{E} = \frac{\vec{F}}{q_0}$$

Where, $$q_0$$ is test charge which become the standard of electric fields.
And its SI unit is a newton per coulomb(N/C).

By the [Coulomb's law](charge), we can get the following equation.

$$\vec{E} = k_e \frac{qq_0}{r^2}\hat{r}\frac{1}{q_0} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q}{r^2}\hat{r}$$

## The electric field due to several point charges

We can find the net electric field as follows.

$$\vec{E} = \sum^n_{i=1}\vec{E_i}$$

## The electric field due to an electric dipole
    
An electric dipole is a system consisting of two equal and opposite charges, q and -q, separated by certain distance.
The equation for a magnitude of its electric field is as follows.

$$E = k_e \frac{2qd}{z^3}$$

Where d is a distance between two charge, and z is a distance between center of two charge and a test charge.
