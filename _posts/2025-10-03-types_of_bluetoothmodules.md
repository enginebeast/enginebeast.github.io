After, I conneted the Bluetooth module with arduino board and started looking for the Bluetooth code on the app's link list. However I couldn't find it. 

At first, I thought I had made an error in my arduino code, or in the circuit wiring, but after some searching I could find another problem.

The Bluetooth module I purchase, HM-10, doesn't support a basic Bluetooth link. It uses specific bluetooth app, nRF connect for mobile. But, it cannot link to app created by MIT app conventor. So, I need to purchase other model to support basic Bluetooth link.

So I had to purchase an HC-06 Bluetooth module, which supports a basic Bluetooth link. From this experience, I realized importance researching commonly usedcomponent, and characteristics of parts I purchase.
